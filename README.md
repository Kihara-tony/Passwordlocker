# DESCRIPTION :page_with_curl:

 This is an app that helps in storing passwords.
 Today we live in a world controlled by technologies.
 We use the technology :satellite:  in everything we do and thus since important documents can be at risk we set up a password of which creating passwordsof all the accounts we have and having to master would be tiresome 
 :weary: .
 In order to remember them you have to remember only one to get all and thus when the app comes to use.

# USE :pencil:
